## Python - Omnik Inverter Client

Asynchronous Python client for the Omnik Inverter.

## About


## Installation

```bash
pip install omnikinverter
```

## Setting up development environment

This Python project is fully managed using the [Poetry][poetry] dependency
manager. But also relies on the use of NodeJS for certain checks during
development.

You need at least:

- Python 3.7+
- [Poetry][poetry-install]

Create a virtualenv and enter it:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

To install all packages, including all development requirements:

```bash
poetry install
pre-commit install
```

As this repository uses the [pre-commit][pre-commit] framework, all changes
are linted and tested with each commit. You can run all checks and tests
manually, using the following command:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

To run just the Python tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```
